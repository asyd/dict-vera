vera (1.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Prior to version 1.6-2, vera and dict-vera were different source
    packages, with different maintainers.  In version 1.6-2, I improperly
    constructed the rules file to install a vera changelog in the vera
    binary package, and a dict-vera changelog in the dict-vera binary
    package.  Starting with this version, the vera changelog is included
    in both packages.  For historical reasons, the dict-vera changelog for
    versions 4.7-1 - 1:1.9-1 is included as
    /usr/share/doc/dict-vera/dict-vera.changelog-old.gz.
